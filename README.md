# Snapdrop iOS App

Snapdrop is a cross-platform and open-source alternative to Apple's Airdrop. Snapdrop's sourcecode can be found here: https://github.com/RobinLinus/snapdrop. This is a simple iOS app which is just a WebView which opens up to the Snapdrop website. This iOS app can make it easier for iOS users to access Snapdrop by making it acessible through the Apple App Store and making it unncesseary to use a web browser to open Snapdrop on iOS.
