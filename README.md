# Not Mantained 
My macbook broke two days after starting this project. All of my other computers exclusively run Linux. I don't feel it is ethical or worth it to buy Apple products anymore so sadly this project won't see any further development by me. It's open source so feel free to take the code and improve it.

# Snapdrop iOS App

Snapdrop is a cross-platform and open-source alternative to Apple's Airdrop. Snapdrop's sourcecode can be found here: https://github.com/RobinLinus/snapdrop. This is a simple iOS app which is just a WebView which opens up to the Snapdrop website. This iOS app can make it easier for iOS users to access Snapdrop by making it acessible through the Apple App Store and making it unncesseary to use a web browser to open Snapdrop on iOS.
